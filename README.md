# A6 Card Sorting

Your readme should include the following information. Each student needs to submit all of this information themselves, even when pair programming. 

## General Information

## Assignment Reflection

```
SelectionSort: 10,000 cards = 1.51s user 0.07s system 98% cpu 1.600 total

InsertionSort: 10,000 =  181.13s user 0.47s system 100% cpu 3:01.30 total

MergeSort: 10,000 cards = 0.82s user 0.06s system 167% cpu 0.524 total

QuickSort: 10,000 cards =  0.76s user 0.06s system 164% cpu 0.499 total

```

What did you notice about the differences in runtime across algorithms as you changed the number of cards you were sorting? If you had to split them into "slower" algorithms vs "faster" algorithms, which would you put in each category?

For most of the algorithms, the runtime does not seem to vary that much depending on the number of cards or the sorting method. However, InsertionSort seemed to have a lot longer runtime compared to the other algoritms. If I had to split the four into faster and slower:

Faster: MergeSort and Quicksort

Slower: SelectionSort and InsertionSort 

Please reflect on your experience with this assignment. What was most challenging? What was most interesting?

This was fun! It was interesting to take abstraction and what we did in class and translate it to code. What was most challenging was debugging and finding out what was wrong with each sorting algorithm. I can see where one can use each sorting algorithm and their uses.
